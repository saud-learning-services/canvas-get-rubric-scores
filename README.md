## Summary

Project to extract rubric and details from Canvas course. Developed initially for Sauder AOL

## Input

You will need to give this tool an active Canvas API token for it to work. There are two methods of doing this (we recommend getting familiar with both):

a. Set your token to the `API_TOKEN` field in the `.env` file (replace "your-token-here")

> `API_TOKEN=your-token-here`
> becomes
> `API_TOKEN=fdfjskSDFj3343jkasdaA...`

b. set your API_INSTANCE 
> `API_INSTANCE = 'https://canvas.ubc.ca'`

## Output

> TBD

## Getting Started

### First Time (do once)

1. Clone this repo: `$ git clone saud-learning-services/canvas-get-rubrics`
   > - this will create the canvas-get-rubrics directory in whichever folder you are set to in terminal (check with `$ pwd` to see current working directory)
   > - see [terminal basics](https://github.com/saud-learning-services/instructions-and-other-templates/blob/main/docs/terminal-basics.md) to change directories
2. Import environment (once): `$ conda env create -f environment.yml`

### Every Time

1. Make sure you are in the right directory: `$ pwd` if it isn't `..../canvas-get-rubrics` then you need to navigate to it: `$ cd {YOUR_PATH}/canvas-get-rubrics`
2. Make sure you have your token (in .env - see [above](#input)
3. Activate the environment: `$ conda activate canvas-get-rubric-scores`
4. Launch jupyter: `$ jupyter notebook`
5. Follow instructions
6. You're basically a wizard now [üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è](https://tenor.com/bo4Bs.gif)
